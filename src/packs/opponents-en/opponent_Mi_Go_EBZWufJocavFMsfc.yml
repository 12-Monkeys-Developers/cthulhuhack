  description: >-
    <h3>The Mi-Go (also known as the Fungi of Yuggoth) are alien creatures
    native to the planet Yuggoth (Pluto) who worship several Other Gods. They
    have the ability, thanks to their wings, to travel in interstellar space.
    <br />The scientifically highly advanced Mi-Go's occasionally visit Earth to
    abduct humans or animals to perform experiments and to perform excavation
    work for ore they cannot find elsewhere. <br />The legends of "Migou", the
    abominable snowman, suggest that a variety of Mi-Go stayed permanently in
    the Himalayan mountains. It should be noted that they know how to extract
    and transport a human brain in special containers to make them travel to
    Yuggoth while preserving its consciousness.</h3>
