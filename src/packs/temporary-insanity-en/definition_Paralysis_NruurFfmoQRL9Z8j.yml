    <p>The character freezes, gripped by fear. They cannot move of&nbsp;their
    own accord for a Minute. Other characters can attempt to carry them&nbsp;or
    drag them, but they're deadweight until they recover - which requires
    a&nbsp;successful CON Save. Failing leaves them statue-like and
    imperiled.</p>
